In this article, I will share the process of rebuilding Tesla's battery range calculator with React.

Disclaimer: This tutorial is a reconstruction of the React version of Todd Motto's [Building Tesla's battery range calculator with Angular 2 reactive forms](https://toddmotto.com/building-tesla-range-calculator-angular-2-reactive-forms). 

So this post will reuse some materials (data,images and css style).
We will focus on rebuilding it in React way.

This is the final GIF image of our application.
